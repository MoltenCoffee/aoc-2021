# Advent of Code 2021

My code for the Advent of Code 2021!

From day 3 onwards, gathering data from the input files is much cleaner due to storing the input in memory, instead of working with a file pointer throughout the code.

Each day can be run using the following snippet (replace the number with the wanted day):

```sh
./run.sh 1
```

`make` and `gcc` are required for this command to work.
